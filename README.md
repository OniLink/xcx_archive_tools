# xcx archive tools
A tool for managing the archive files found in Xenoblade X Definitive Edition.

Licensed under [GNU GPL v3.0 or later](LICENSE.md).

## About
A command line tool for extracting files from arh/ard file pairs used by MonolithSoft's Xenoblade engine. Designed specifically to work on the simplified archive format used starting in Xenoblade X Definitive Edition.

As filenames in the archive are hashed, a list of filenames can be provided in a separate text file in order to "de-hash" the files on extraction.

You can extract individual files, lists of files, or even the entire archive at once.
